In order to tap into our limitless potential, we emphasize on understanding one’s self and connecting that with the world.</p>

But do they have enough vantage to know themselves to   make these choices authentically? Do our homes, schools or places of work nurture them to develop and build their own conscious thought?

          <h1>Our Theory Of <br> Change</h1>
          <br>
          <div class="tab" id="para" style="display:none;">
            <p>At Creatnet, we believe in the idea of life-long learning. Human beings  are curious by nature and it is our eagerness to learn and grow that drives action. <b>Our actions are reflections and manifestation of our thoughts, thus changing the outer environment starts with changing ourselves.</b></p>
            <p>Hence, our programs are built upon the inherent capacity of the human beings to bring about a change in themselves, and as a result transform the very institutions and structures they are a part of. </p>
            <p>This process holds to its core a few practices</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personalized learning in small groups of 10 where dialogue, discussion and questioning is of utmost importance. Where individual expression is encouraged and authenticity is valued. </li>
              <li>Blossoming creativity by connecting with oneself</li>
              <li>Moving from self awareness to group awareness to build empathy</li>
              
            </ul>
            <p>Even though most people believe they are self-aware, self-awareness is a truly rare quality: Research estimates that only 10%–15% of the people we studied actually fit the criteria.
</p>
            <p>Internal self-awareness(represents how clearly we see our own values, passions, aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions and impact on others) has been associated with higher job and relationship satisfaction, personal and social control, and happiness; it is negatively related to anxiety, stress, and depression.</p>
            <p>While research suggests that external self-awareness (understanding how other people view us) makes people more skilled at showing empathy and taking others’ perspectives. </p>
            <p>In times of constant flux and change in terms of our work and contemporary lifestyles, we find self awareness to be a practice of essential and utmost importance.  The summer program aims to flower and deepen this enquiry for each participant and hence build the next  generation of conscientious young leaders
